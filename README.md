# markdown-cv

got fed up with TeX compilation errors when working with standard templates for academic CVs. here's a minimal and easily configurable CV that uses markdown.

result: [CV-SH.pdf](CV-SH.pdf)

source:  [CV-SH.Rmd](CV-SH.Rmd)
![](CV-SH.pdf)

the source also contains a "references" section that is commented out in my current version.
