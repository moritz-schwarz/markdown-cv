# markdown-cv with [quarto](https://quarto.org/)

Tried to adjust Simon He√ü' nice R Markdown cv for non-R users who compile with quarto. Under the hood this is all LaTeX, Pandoc, and a tiny bit of R, so this should be doable. Perhaps, this is useful for someone else adjusting an R Markdown document to a quarto environment.

result: [CV-SH.pdf](CV-SH.pdf)

source:  [CV-SH.qmd](CV-SH.qmd)

Only hiccups:
- the yaml header is slightly different for quarto documents
- quarto does not like the LaTeX package `titlesec` and throws an error which can be addressed in several ways, see [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6598).
- install R and the scholar package (takes a few min for non-R user)
